- [ ] Launch training on dataset from PAN
- [ ] Do general Lit stub (configured completely from config)
- [ ] Distribute code into git repos
- [x] Code NN parser module (to parse models, datasets from config and everything related to NN training)

    > Each object contains its own parser part
    > Each object should be initialized with simple types and contain all needed parsers to decode it from configs
